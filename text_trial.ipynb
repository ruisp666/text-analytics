    "For simplicity, we will assume three steps on our NLP pipeline: Text processing, feature extraction, and modelling. In fact before we model anything, we need to take into consideration two empirically verified assumptions:\n",
    "1) Text is often, by its unstructured nature, noisy.\n",
    "2) Models work best when data has been de-noised (e.g. try to use Computer Vision application with singificantly blurred images).\n",
    "\n",
    "So before we are in a position to apply models to text tasks, we need to take some time processing the raw text. Let us now see what are the normal steps when we deal with Text Processing.\n"

    "We are going to assume the following sequence of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Normalize by case**: Here, transform all the text to lower caps. If we are still working with a single string, we can use a single command once (str.lower()) to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Remove Punctutation**: This can assume different forms, but one may simply start with removing commas. This will preserve the sentence organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Tokenization**: Until now, text was a single string, we now want to split it into sentences and words.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Remove Stop Words**: Remove some of the most common words such as \"and\" or \"this\". It can also be tweaked to a specific domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Steming/Lemmatization**: To reduced complexity, we can try to reduce related words to a common root word using Steming or Lemmatization. While Stemming reduces complexity by tryng to find a common stem around words, Lemmatization uses a known mapping to reduce words to their base form, usually depending on the syntatic function of the word (verb, noun, adverb). Note that while Lemmatization produces meaningful words, stemming may not do that.\n",

      "Colette Kress:, Thanks, Will, for the question., You are correct., We have indicated a couple of quarters ago that we were starting to see improved visibility after we came out of the digestion period in the prior overall fiscal year., As we move into Q2, we still have visibility and solid visibility into our Q2 results for overall data centers., So at this time, I'd say they are relatively about the same of what we had seen going into the Q1 period., And we think that is a true indication of their excitement about our platform and most particularly our excitement regarding A100, and that's launched and its additional products., Now regarding the second half of the year, as you know, we have seen broad-based growth in both the hyperscale and the vertical industries, both of them in terms of at record levels., In our Q1 results., And we see in terms of inferencing continuing to grow as well, as well as we're also expanding in terms of edge AI., Our strong demand of the A100 products, including the Delta Board, but also in terms of our DGXs, was just starting an initial ramp., However, we do guide only 1 quarter at a time., So it's still a little bit too early for us to give a true certainty in terms of the macro situation that's in front of us., But again, we feel very good about the demand for A100., \n",

      ", Jensen Huang:, Yes., Thanks a lot, Joe., So first of all, taking a step back., Accelerated computing is now common sense in data centers., It wasn't the case when we first launched Volta., If you went back to Volta, Volta was the first generation that the deep learning training in a really serious way, and it was really focused on training., It was focused on training and high-performance computing., We didn't come until later with the inference version called T4., But over the course of the last 5 years, we've been accelerating workloads that are now diversifying in data centers., If you take a look at most of the hyperscalers, machine learning is now pervasive., Deep learning is now pervasive., The notion of accelerated deep learning and machine learning using our GPUs is now common sense., It didn't used to be., People still saw it as something esoteric., But today, data centers all over the world expect a very significant part of their data center being accelerated with GPUs., The number of workloads that we've accelerated since in the last 5 years have expanded tremendously, whether it's imaging or video or conversational AI or deep recommender systems that probably unquestionably, at this point, the most important machine learning model in the world., And so the number of applications we now accelerate is quite diverse., And so that's really -- that's contributed greatly to the ramp of Ampere., When we came -- when we started to introduce Ampere to the data center, it was very commonsensical to them that they would adopt it., They have a large amount of workload that's already accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs., And as you know, our GPUs are architecturally compatible from generation to generation., We're forward compatible or backwards compatible., Everything that runs on T4 runs on A100, everything that runs on V100 runs on A100., And so I think the transition is going to be really, really smooth., On the other hand, because V100 and T4 -- which, by the way, V100 and T4 had a great quarter., It was sequentially up., And then on top of that, we grew with the A100 shipment., A100 -- or excuse me, V100 and T4 are now quite broadly adopted in hyperscalers for their AI services, in cloud computing, in a vertical industries, which is almost roughly half of our overall HPC business., All the way out to the edge, which had a great quarter., Much smaller part, of course -- supercomputing is important, but it's a very small part of the high-performance computing., But that's also -- we also shipped A100 to supercomputing centers., And so I think the general sense of it -- the summary of it is that the number of workloads for accelerated computing has continued to grow, the adoption of machine learning and AI and all the cloud and hyperscalers has grown., The common sense of using acceleration is now a foregone conclusion., And so I think we're ramping into a very receptive market with a really fantastic -- with a really fantastic product., \n",

      "Colette Kress:, So let me start on the first question regarding the gross margin and our gross margin as we look into Q2., We are guiding Q2 non-GAAP gross margins at 66%., This is -- would be another record gross margin quarter just as we finished an overall record level, even as we are continuing right now to ramp our overall Ampere architecture within that., The Q2 also incorporates Mellanox., Mellanox has a very similar overall margins to our overall data center margins as well., But we see this new baseline as a great transition and likely to see some changes as we go forward., However, it's still a little early to see where these gross margins will go., But we're very pleased with the overall guidance right now at 66% for Q2., \n",
      "Jensen Huang: Accelerated computing is just at the beginning of its journey., If you look at -- I would characterize it as several segments., First is hyperscaler AI microservices, which is all the services that we enjoy today that has AI., Whenever you shop on the web, it recommends a product., When you're watching a movie, it recommends a movie or it recommends a song., All of those -- or recommends news or recommends a friend or recommends a website, the first 10 websites that they recommend., All of these recommenders that are powering the Internet are all based on machine learning today., It's the reason why they're collecting so much data., The more data they can collect, the more they could predict your preference, and that predicting your preference is the core to a personalized Internet., It used to be largely based on CPU approaches., But going forward, it's all based on deep learning approaches., The results are much more superior and a few percentage change in preference prediction accuracy could result in tens of billions of dollars of economics., And so this is very, very big deal., And the shift towards deep learning in hyperscale micro services or AI micro services is still ramping., Second is cloud., And as you know, cloud is a $100 billion market segment of it today, growing about 40% into $1 trillion opportunity., Cloud computing is the single largest IT industry transformation that we have ever seen., The two powers that is really -- the force -- the two forces that is really driving our data center business is AI and cloud computing., We're perfectly, perfectly positioned to benefit from these two powerful forces., So the second is cloud computing., And that journey is -- has a long ways to go., Then the third is industrial edge., In the future, today -- it's not the case today., But the combination of IoT, 5G, industrial 5G and artificial intelligence, it's going to turn every single industry into a tech industry., And whether it's logistics or warehousing or manufacturing or farming, construction, industrial, every single industry will become a tech industry., And there'll be trillions of sensors, and they'll be connected to little micro data centers., And those data centers will be in the millions., They'll be distributed all over the edge., And that journey has just barely started., We announced 3 very important partners in 3 domains., And they're the lead partners that we felt that people would know, but we have several hundred partners that are working with us on edge AI., We announced Walmart for smart retail., We announced the U. S. Postal Service, the world's largest mail sorting service and logistics service., And then we announced this last quarter, BMW, who is working with us to transform their factory into a robotics, automated factory of the future., And so these 3 applications are great examples of the next phase of artificial intelligence and where Ampere is going to ramp into., And that is just really at its early stages., And so I think it's fair to say that we're really well positioned in the 2 fundamental forces of IT today, data center scale computing and artificial intelligence., And the segments that it's going to make a real impact are all gigantic markets., Hyperscale AI, cloud and edge AI., \n",

      "[It's going to be infectious disease., And I think every nation and government and scientific lab is now gearing up to think about what does it take to create a national defense system for each country that is based on computational methods?, And NVIDIA is an accelerated computing company., We take something that otherwise would take a year in the case of Oak Ridge, and they filter 1 billion compounds in a day., And that's what you need to do., You need to find a way to have an accelerated computational defense system that allows you to find insight, detect early warning ASAP., And then, of course, the computational system has to go through the entire range from mitigation to containment to living within the monitoring., And so scientific labs are going to be gearing up., National labs are going to be gearing up., The third part is AI and robotics., We're going to have to have the ability to be able to do our work remotely., NVIDIA has a lot of robots that are helping us in our labs., And without those robots helping us in our labs, we'll have a hard time getting our work done., And so we need to have remote autonomous capability for -- to handle all of these -- either dangerous circumstances to disinfect environments, to fumigate environments autonomously, to clean environments, to be able to interact with people where as little as possible in the event of an outbreak., All kinds of robotics applications are being dreamed up right now to help society forward in the case of another outbreak., And then lastly, I think more and more people are going to work permanently from home., There's a strong movement of companies that are going to support a larger percentage of people working from home., And when people work from home, it's going to clearly increase the single best home entertainment, which is video games., I think video games is going to represent a much larger segment of the overall entertainment budget of society., And so these are some of the trends, I would say., I would say cloud computing, AI., I would say national labs, a computational defense system, robotics and working from home are structural changes that are going to be here to stay., And these dynamics are really good for us., \n",

      "Jensen Huang:, Yes., Thanks for the call, Mark., Good Question., I think the -- if you take a step back, currently in our data centers, the current setup in data centers, starting from probably all the way back, 6, 7 years ago, but really accelerating in the last 5 years and then really accelerating in the last couple of years, we learned our way into it., There are 3 classes of workloads, and they kind of came into acceleration over time., The first class of workload that we discovered was -- the major workload was deep learning training., Deep learning training., And the ideal setup for that today prior to Ampere or yesterday prior to Ampere is the V100 SXM with NVLink, 8 GPUs on one board, and that architecture is called scale up., It's like a supercomputer architecture., It's like a -- it's like a weather simulation architecture., You're trying to build the largest possible computing node you can for one operating system called scale up., And the second thing that we learned along the way was then cloud computing started to grow because researchers around the world needed to get access to an accelerated platform for developing their machine learning algorithms., And because they have a different degree of budget, and they want to get into it, a little bit more lightly and have the ability to scale up to larger nodes, the perfect model for that was actually a V100 PCI Express, not SXM, but PCI Express that allows you to offer 1 GPU all the way up to many GPUs., And so that versatility, V100 PCI Express, not as scalable in performance as the V100 SXMs, but it was much more flexible for rentals., Cloud renting was really quite ideal., And then we started to get into inference, and we're on our seventh generation of TensorRT, TensorRT 7.0., Along the way, we've been able to accelerate more and more., And today, we largely accelerate every deep learning inference computational graph that's out there., And the ideal GPU for that was something that has the reduced precision, which is called [indiscernible], reduced precision not with electronics that is focused more for inference -- and because inference is a scale-out application, where you have millions of queries, and each one of the queries are quite small versus scale up, where you have 1 training job and that 1 training job is running for a day., It could be running for days and sometimes even weeks., And so scale-up application is for 1 user that uses it for a long period of time on a very large machine., Scale out, it's for millions of users, each one of them have a very small query and that query could last hundreds of milliseconds and where ideally, you like to get it done in hundreds of milliseconds., And so notice, I've said 3 different architecture in a data center today., Most data centers today has a storage server, has CPU servers, and it has scale-up acceleration service with Voltas has scaled out servers with GeForce and then it has scale cloud computing, flexible servers based on V100., And so the ability to predict workload is so hard, and therefore, the utilization of these systems will be spiky., And so we created an architecture that allows for 3 things., So things -- the 3 characteristics of Ampere are: number one, it is the greatest generational leap in history., I mean I don't remember a generation where we increased throughput for training and inference by 20x., And it's just a gigantic -- for training and for inference, it is a gigantic leap forward., The second, it's the first architecture that is unified., We could use this to the computational -- the computation engine of Ampere accelerates the moment the data comes into the data center., From data processing, it's called ETO; the engine, which many of you probably know, it's the single most important computational engine in the world today for big data., It used to be Hadoop, but now it's Spark., Spark is used all over the world, 16,000 customers., We finally have the ability to accelerate that., And then it's --, Ampere is also good for training, deep learning, machine learning, extra boost as well as deep learning, all the way out to inference., And so we now have a unified acceleration platform for the entire workload., And then the third thing is it's the first GPU ever, the first acceleration platform ever that's elastic., You could reconfigure it., You could configure it for either scale up or you can configure it for scale out., When you configure it for scale up, you're gaining a whole bunch of GPUs together using NVLink, and it creates this 1 gigantic GPU., When you want to scale it out, that same computation node becomes 56 small GPUs., Each one of those 56 partitions, each 1 is more powerful than Volta., I mean it's really quite extraordinary., And so Ampere is a breakthrough on all of these fronts for performance for the fact that it unifies the workload, and you can now have 1 acceleration cluster; and then number three, it's elastic., You could use in the cloud, you could use a for inference, you could use it for training., And so the versatility of Ampere is the thing that I'm most excited about., And now you could have 1 acceleration cluster that serves all of your needs., That's very helpful., \n",

      "[\n",
      "Jensen Huang:, Colette, did you want to handle that first?, And then I'll do the..., \n",
      ", Colette Kress:, Sure., So let me help you out on the overall GAAP adjustments, so the delta between our GAAP OpEx and our non-GAAP OpEx., If you look at it for the full year and what we guided, we probably have about $1.55 billion associated with GAAP level expenses., Keep in mind, there is more in there than just our stock-based compensation., We have also incorporated the accounting that we will do for the overall Mellanox, and a really good portion of those costs are associated with the amortization of intangibles and also in terms of acquisition-related costs and deal fees and onetime items., So our stock-based compensation includes what we need for NVIDIA and also the onboarding of Mellanox., There is some retention with the overall onboarding of Mellanox., But for the most part, it is just working them in to the year for three quarters, which is influencing the stock-based compensation, ., \n",
      "Jensen Huang:, Tim, there are several differences between our condition then and our condition today., So the first -- the first difference is the diversity of workload we now accelerate., Back then, we were early in our inference., We were still early in our inference, and most of the data center acceleration was used for deep learning., And so today, the versatility stands from data processing to deep learning and the number of -- the number of different types of AI models that's being trained for deep learning is growing tremendously from detecting, from training video, from training a model to detecting unsafe video., The natural language understanding the conversational AI to now a gigantic movement towards deep recommender systems., And so the number of different models that are being trained is growing., The size of the models are gigantic., Recommendation systems are gigantic., They're training on models that are hundreds., The data sizes, hundreds of terabytes., Terabytes, hundreds of terabytes., And it would take tens of -- hundreds of servers to hold all of the data that is needed to train these recommender systems., And so the diversity of -- from data analytics to training all the different models to the influence of all different models., We didn't inference recurring elements at a time, which is probably the most important model today., Text language models, speech models are all recurrent, Euronet models., And so those models were early for us at the time., So number one is the diversity of workload., The second is the acceleration of -- to cloud computing., I think that accelerated cloud computing is a movement that is going to be a multiyear if not a decade-long transition., From where we are today, it's only $100 billion industry segment of the IT industry., It's going to be $1 trillion someday, and that movement is just starting., We're also much more diversified out of the clouds., At the time, cloud was largely where our acceleration went for deep learning., And today, hyperscale only represents about half., And so we've diversified significantly out of cloud, not out of cloud, but including vertical industries., And a lot of that has to do with edge AI and inference., And as I mentioned earlier, we're working with Walmart and BMW and USPS, and that's just the tip of the iceberg., And so I think the conditions are a little different., And then what I would say lastly is Ampere., I mean we are -- we've ramped a few weeks., Even though it was quite significant, it was a great ramp., The demand is fantastic., It is the best ramp we've ever had., The demand is the strongest we've ever had in data centers., And we're starting to ramp of a multiyear ramp., And so -- those are some of the differences., I think the conditions are very different., \n",

      ", Jensen Huang:, Yes., Great., Thanks a lot, Harlan., I appreciate the question., So DGX, you know this is our third-generation DGX and it's really successful., People love it., It's the most advanced AI instrument in the world., If you're a serious AI researcher, this is your instrument., And in the DGX, there are 8 A100s and there are 9 Mellanox NICs, the highest speed NICs they have., And so we have a great appreciation for high-performance networking., High-performance networking and high-performance computing go hand-in-hand., And the reason for that is because the problems we're trying to solve no longer fit in one computer, no matter how big it is., And so it has to be distributed., And when you distribute a computational workload of such intense scale, the communications overhead becomes one of its greatest bottlenecks, which is the reason why Mellanox is so valuable., There's reason why this company is so precious and really a jewel and one of a kind., And so -- and it's not just about the link speed., It's not mostly., I mean we just have a deep appreciation for software., It's a combination of architecture and software and electronics design, chip design., And in that combination, Mellanox is just world-class., And that's the reason why they're in 60% of the world's supercomputers., That's why they're in 100% of the AI supercomputers., And their understanding of large-scale distributed computing is second to none., Now in the world of -- and I just talked about scale up., And you're absolutely right.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question + Answer 31 \n",
      "[And you're absolutely right., Now the question is why scale out?, And the reason for that is this., This is the reason why they're doing so well., The movement towards disaggregated microservice applications where containers, microservice containers are distributed all over the data center and orchestrated so that the workload could be distributed across a very large hyperscale data center., That architecture -- and you probably know the 3 most important application in my estimation in the world today, number one, would be TensorFlow and PyTorch; number two would be Spark; and number three would be Kubernetes., And you could rank it however you desire., And these 3 applications, in the case of Kubernetes, it's a brand-new type of application where the application is broken up with a small pieces and orchestrated across an entire data center., And because it's broken up into small pieces and orchestrate across the entire data center, the networking between the compute nodes becomes the bottleneck again., And that's the reason why they're doing so well., By increasing the network performance by offloading the communications of the CPUs, you increase the throughput of a data center tremendously., And so it's the reason why they had a record quarter last quarter., It's the reason why they've been growing 27% per year., And their stock was back, their integration into the hyperscale cloud companies, they're low latency, they're incredibly low latency of their link makes them really unique, even whether it's Ethernet or InfiniBand in both cases., And so they're -- it's a really fantastic stack., And then lastly, Cumulus, we would like to integrate -- we would like to innovate in this world where the world is moving away from just a CPU as a compute node., The new computing unit, a software developer is writing a piece of software that runs on the entire data center., In the future, going forward, the computing, the fundamental computing unit is an entire data center., It's so incredible., It's just utterly incredible., You write an application, 1 human could write an application, and it would literally activate an entire data center., And in that world, we would like to be able to innovate from end to end, from networking storage, security., Everything has to be secured in the future so that we can reduce the attack surface down to practically nothing., And so networking storage, security are all completely offloaded, all incredibly low latency, all incredibly high performance and all the way to compute, all the way through the switch., And then the second thing is we'd like to be able to innovate across the entire stack., You know that NVIDIA is just supremely obsessed about software stacks., And the reason for that is because software creates markets., You can't create new markets like we're talking about, whether it's computational health care or autonomous driving or robotic or conversational AI or recommender systems or edge AI., All of that requires software stacks., It takes software to create markets., And so our obsession about software and creating open platforms for the ecosystem and all of our developer partners, Cumulus plays perfectly into that., They are -- they pioneered the open networking stack., And they pioneered, in a lot of ways, software-defined data centers., And so we're super, super excited about the team., And now we have the ability to innovate in a data center scale world from end to end and then from top to bottom of the entire stack., \n",

      "[How much accelerated computing do you use?, And what part of the date in your pipeline do you do it?And the big -- the gigantic breakthrough, of course, we know well now, and NVIDIA is recognized as one of the three pillars that ignited the modern AI, the big bang of modern AI., And the other two pillar, of course, is deep learning algorithm and the abundance of data., And so these three ingredients came together and was -- people use NVIDIA accelerated computing largely for training., But over time, we expanded training to have a lot more models., And as I mentioned earlier, the single most important model of machine learning today is the recommender system., It's the most important model because it's the only way that you and I could use the Internet in any reasonable way., It's the only way that you and I could use a shopping website or a video web -- a video app or a music app or book or news or anything., And so it is the engine of the Internet from the consumer's perspective., On the company perspective, it is the engine of commerce., Without the recommender system, there's no way they could possibly make money., And so their accuracy in predicting user preferences is core to everything they do., You just go up and down the list of every company., And that engine is gigantic., It is just a gigantic engine., And from the data processing part of it, which is the reason why we went and spent 3 years on Spark and RAPIDS, which made Spark possible and all the work that we did on NVLink and all that stuff was really focused on big data analytics., The second is all of the training of the deep learning models and the inference., So the number of applications, the footprint, the accelerated computing has grown tremendously, and its importance has grown tremendously because of the applications are the most important applications of these companies., And so I think when I mentioned -- when I said that, that acceleration is still growing, it is., But the major workloads, the most important workloads of the world's most important companies are now -- solidly require acceleration., And so I'm looking forward to a really exciting ramp for Ampere for all the reasons that I just mentioned., \n",

This suggests that we may have to remove the influence of the size of the sentence from the importance of the word, or will have to have to factor that when making computations. As next step to encode text, is not encode group of tokens (i.e sentences into sparse vectors), but encode them into a fixed-dimensional space that preserve some expected properties such similarity for instance. That is the objective of the Embedding schemes, homeomorphisms between a Corpus and a subset of the n-dimensional vector space. Let us describe some of those."
